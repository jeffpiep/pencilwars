# pencilWars
I wrote this game to learn some Python. This game is detailed in [Tom Angleberger's _Oragami Yoda](http://origamiyoda.com/) and is just like the paper games I played as a kid. It is built using the [pygame 1.9](http://www.pygame.org/) package and runs in either 2.7 or 3.4.

game logic:  
1. player X chooses ship  
2. flicks pencil  
3. find if flick collided with other ship  
4. if collide, destroy other ship; else, move ship  
5. player Y's turn
