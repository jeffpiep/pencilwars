# pencilwars
I wrote this game to learn some Python. The idea comes from the paper games I played as a kid. This version is detailed in [Tom Angleberger's _Oragami Yoda_.](http://origamiyoda.com/)

game logic:  
1. player X chooses ship  
2. flicks pencil  
3. find if flick collided with other ship  
4. if collide, destroy other ship; else, move ship  
5. player Y's turn
